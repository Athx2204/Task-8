2. Connected to a free server (Netherlands).
3. Verified IP before VPN connection:
   - IP: 103.147.120.109 (India)

## Observations
- IP address changed successfully, confirming VPN tunneling.
- Traffic was encrypted using WireGuard (UDP).
- Connection speed was slightly reduced due to encryption.
- VPN improved privacy by masking real IP.

## Benefits of VPN
- Hides real IP and location.
- Encrypts traffic to prevent eavesdropping.
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions.

## Limitations of VPN
- Free plans have limited speed and server options.
- Not a guarantee of complete anonymity.
- Some websites may block VPN traffic.
